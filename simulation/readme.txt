These are the scripts to generate simulations. Please change the path of softwares and the workdir. The ground truth is saved in each folder.

## Synthetic1 : This folder saves the scripts to generate Synthetic1.
## Synthetic1_S_aureus : This folder saves the scripts to generate mixtures with S. aureus. strains.
## Synthetic2 : This folder saves the scripts to generate Synthetic2.
## Synthetic3_4 : This folder saves the scripts to generate Synthetic3 and 4.
## Synthetic5: The scripts in this folder are used to generate contamination reads.
## Synthetic6 : This folder saves the scripts to generate mixtures with different reads error.
## synthetic7 : This folder saves the scripts to generate mixtures with different alignment length.
## synthetic8 : This folder saves the scripts to generate mixtures with different reads length.
## synthetic9 : This folder saves the scripts to generate mixtures with very low depth, this data set was used to test the usage of pseudocount..
## reference_set : The reference set to generate mixtures.
