#The ground truth of strains abundance and genotypes is recorded in the folder of each mixture.
#The mixture is generated by the script simulation_gemsim.sh. In this simulation, we use Gemsim to generate strains haplotypes, and use wgsim to generate reads with different errors.
#The reference set is the marker genes of E. coli. The name is phlan2.fa. 
#These are mixtures varying the reads error (0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05).
