#The ground truth of strains abundance and genotypes is recorded in the folder of each mixture.
#The mixture is generated by the script simulation_gemsim.sh.
#The reference set is the marker genes of E. coli. The name is phlan2.fa. 
#The mixtures with number of strains from 2-4 are synthetic 3, the mixtures with k from 2-25 are synthetic 4.
