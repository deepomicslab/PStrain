#The ground truth of strains abundance and genotypes is recorded in the folder of each mixture.
#The mixture is generated by the script simulation_gemsim.sh.
#The reference set is the marker genes of E. coli. The name is phlan2.fa. 
#These are mixtures varying the alignment length (SNVs number: 100, 300, 900, 1200),The mixtures with 100 SNVs are in synthetic 1.
